# Text-Generator
Enter some text and it will generate an elaborated version of your text.
It uses GPT 2 model from HuggingFace.
I haven't downloaded the model from the server so when ever you run the source code it will connect to the HuggingFace server and the the GPT2 model to generate your new text.
If you want you can download the model into your local directory and path of that directory for faster and Network Connection-less process.
